# Luiz Vicente Portfolio
The MVP of this project was developed in one week, from conception to deployment and since then has continued to be constantly updated to add new information and interactions.

This project is the personal portfolio of the creator of this profile ([@Luiz-Vicente](https://www.github.com/Luiz-Vicente)), therefore, copying this repository for reuse is not authorized, however, I encourage and I'm happy if you decide to clone this repository on your local machine to study and/or modify it to create your own.
